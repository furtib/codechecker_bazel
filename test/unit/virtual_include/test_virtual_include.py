"""
We want CodeChecker to point to the original files in its results, this needs
post processing.
Bazel creates _virtual_includes folder for headers, declared in a cc_library
rule with the include_prefix or strip_include_prefix. When warnings are found
in these headers, their paths in the plist files should get resolved to the
original file path.
This unittest test whether these paths containing `_virtual_include` have been
resolved
